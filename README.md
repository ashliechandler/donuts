Hello.

Welcome to my donut shop site!

What you will see on the webpage is a table listing five donut shop locations on the left, the hours of operation (7 am to 6 pm) at the top, a series of totals on the right, and a bunch of random numbers in between.

What my script is doing is generating a random number of customers every hour (11 different times), multiplying the random numbers by the average number of donuts purchased at each location per hour, and then adding the number of donuts needed every hour at each location to satisfy donut demand for the entire day.

I hope you like it. Enjoy.
